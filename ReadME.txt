# MEAN Web Agency

Welcome to the repository for the MEAN Web Agency - a full-stack application designed to showcase the capabilities of the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js). This application serves as a practical learning journey through modern web development practices and technologies.

## Overview

The MEAN Web Agency app is a simulated platform for a digital agency that offers web development services. It demonstrates CRUD operations by interfacing with a MongoDB database, using Express.js to handle API requests, Angular for a dynamic and responsive frontend, and Node.js as the runtime environment.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Data is retrieved from MongoDB, ensuring that the content is dynamic and persistent.
- **RESTful API**: The backend is built with Express.js and provides a RESTful API for handling CRUD operations.
- **Reactive Forms**: Implements Angular's reactive forms for robust form handling and validation.
- **Responsive Design**: Crafted with a mobile-first approach, ensuring compatibility across a wide range of devices.
